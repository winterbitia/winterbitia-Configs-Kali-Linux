# Winterbitia's Kali Linux Configuration

> Place the files at `~/.config/` and the path-scripts on your `$PATH`

These are the main configurations used for my **Kali Linux** setup. Unfortunately, a lot of the directory paths have to be tuned for use with other devices, and certain scripts have to be moved to the `$PATH` for some of these configurations to function properly. *(I'm looking at you, the 3 line bash script to reset picom.)* Other than that, it should be clean and usable enough for my first time ricing a linux distro. Available configurations include:
* i3wm
* picom {(jonaburg's fork)]
* polybar
* dunst
* kitty
* rofi
* betterlockscreen
* $PATH scripts used
    * [rofi-wifi-menu](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/rofi-wifi-menu)
    * [rofi-power-menu](https://github.com/jluttine/rofi-power-menu)
    * picomreset

## Notable Dependencies

While these services don't neccessarily contain configuration files, they're very crucial in my setup to install on my window manager to have it running properly.
* i3-gaps
* kali-desktop-xfce
* lxpolkit
* feh

## Rose Pine Themes

Rose Pine Moon is one of the few color schemes I looked at for a short while and instantly fell in love with, to the point where I've used the scheme in many of my applications. You can find the themes listed in their [website](https://rosepinetheme.com/).
